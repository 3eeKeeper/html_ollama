# Thinking Models Feature Implementation

## ✅ Feature Successfully Implemented

The CR Chatbot now supports thinking models with a professional collapsible interface for displaying the AI's reasoning process.

## 🎯 Feature Overview

When an AI model (like o1) includes thinking steps in its response using `<think>` tags, the chatbot will:

1. **Automatically detect** thinking content wrapped in `<think>...</think>` tags
2. **Extract and hide** the thinking process from the main response
3. **Display a collapsible section** with a "🤔 Thinking process" button
4. **Show clean responses** with the thinking process hidden by default
5. **Allow users to expand** the thinking section to see the AI's reasoning

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Changes (`script.js`)
- **Enhanced `formatMessageContent()` method** to detect and process `<think>` tags
- **Added `toggleThinkingContent()` method** for handling expand/collapse functionality
- **Updated `renderMessage()` method** to attach event listeners to thinking toggle buttons
- **Proper HTML escaping** for both main content and thinking content
- **Unique ID generation** for each thinking section to avoid conflicts

### CSS Styles (`styles.css`)
- **Professional thinking section styling** with subtle brown theme
- **Smooth animations** for expand/collapse with rotating arrow icon
- **Hover effects** and focus states for accessibility
- **Dark mode support** with appropriate color adjustments
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes

### Features
- **🤔 Visual indicator** with brain emoji and italic styling
- **Collapsible interface** that defaults to collapsed state
- **Click to expand** functionality with visual feedback
- **Proper formatting** preserving line breaks and spacing
- **Accessibility compliant** with proper focus states and ARIA support

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Collapsed State (Default)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▶ 🤔 Thinking process               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
Good morning! 🌞 How can I assist you today?
```

### Expanded State (When Clicked)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▼ 🤔 Thinking process               │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🤔 Okay, the user said "good       │
│ morning." I should respond politely.│
│ Let me check the time to make sure  │
│ it's actually morning...            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
Good morning! 🌞 How can I assist you today?
```

## 📝 Example Usage

### Input Message with Thinking
```
<think>
Okay, the user said "good morning." I should respond politely. Let me check the time to make sure it's actually morning. If it's daytime, maybe say "good afternoon" instead. But since the user used "good morning," I'll go with that. I should add a friendly greeting and offer help. Keep it simple and positive.
</think>

Good morning! 🌞 How can I assist you today?
```

### Rendered Output
- **Thinking section**: Collapsible with brown-tinted background
- **Main response**: Clean display without thinking tags
- **User interaction**: Click to expand/collapse thinking process
